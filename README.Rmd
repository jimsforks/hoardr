`hoard` - manage cached files

Exposes a single `R6` object so that when the package is imported in another
package for managing cached files, you don't need to polute the NAMESPACE 
with a bunch of functions. (you can always just `hoard::fxn`, but 
with a single object there are other benefits as well [maintaining state, e.g.]).

## install

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/hoard")
```

```{r}
library(hoard)
```

## usage

initialize client

```{r}
(x <- hoard::hord())
```

set cache path

```{r}
x$cache_path_set("foobar")
```

make the directory if doesn't exist

```{r}
x$mkdir()
```

put a file in the cache

```{r}
cat("hello world", file = file.path(x$cache_path_get(), "foo.txt"))
```

list the files

```{r}
x$list()
```

details

```{r}
x$details()
```

delete by file name

```{r}
x$delete("foo.txt")
x$list()
```
